# you can keep all the fixtures in this module by the name of `conftest.py`
'''
'conftest.py' is a special file used in pytest, a popular testing framework for Python. The purpose of 'conftest.py' is to define fixtures and configuration options that can be shared across multiple test modules or packages within a pytest project.

By defining fixtures in 'conftest.py', they become available to all test modules without the need for import statements or duplicating code.
