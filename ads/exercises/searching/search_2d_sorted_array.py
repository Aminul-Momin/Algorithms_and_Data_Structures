"""
Design an algorithm that takes a 2D sorted array and a number and checks whether that numberappears in the array. For example, if the input is the 2D sorted array in Figure 1.1.3, and the numberis 7, your algorithm should retum false; if the number is 8, your algorithm should return true.

Hint: Can you eliminate a row or a column per comparison?
