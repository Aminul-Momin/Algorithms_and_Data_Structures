The storage capacity of hard drives dwarfs that of RAM. This can lead to interesting space-timetrade-ofb.Suppose you were given a file containing roughly one billion IP addresses, each of which is a 32-bitquantity. How would you programmatically find an IP address that is not in the file? Assume youhave unlimited drive space but only a few megabytes of RAM at your disposal.Hint: Can you be sure there is an address which is not in the file?
