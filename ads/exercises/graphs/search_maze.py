"""
It is natural to apply graph models and algorithms to spatial problems. Consider a black and whitedigitized image of a maze-white pixels represent open â‚¬ueas and black spaces are walls. There aretwo special white pixels: one is designated the entrance and the other is the exit. The goal in thisproblem is to find a way of getting from the entrance to the exit, as illustrated in Figure 18.5 on thenext page.

Given a 2D array of black and white entries representing a maze with designated entrance and exit points, find a path from the entrance to the exit, if one exists.

Hint: Model the maze as a graph.
