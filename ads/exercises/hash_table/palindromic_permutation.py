""" Test for Plindromic Permutation.

palindrome is a string that reads the same forvrrards and backwards, e.g., "level", "rotator", and"foobaraboof".
Write a program to test whether the letters forming a string can be permuted to form a palindrome.For example, "edified" can be permuted to form "deified".
Hint: Find a simple characterization of strings that can be permuted to form a palindrome.
