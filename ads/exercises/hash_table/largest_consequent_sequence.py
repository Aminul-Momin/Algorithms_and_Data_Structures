"""
Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns an array of
length two representing the largest range of numbers contained in that array.
The first number in the output array should be the first number while the
second number should be the last number in largest range. A range of numbers
is defined as a set of numbers that comes right after each other in the set
of real numbers. For instane, the output array [2,6] represents the range
[2,3,4,5,6], which is a range of length 5. Note that numbers do not need to be
ordered or adjacent in the array in order to form a range. Assume there will be
only one largest range.
Simple Input: [1,11,3,0,15,5,2,4,10,7,12,6]
Simple Output: [0,7]
