You are given a sequence of adjacent buildings. Each has unit width and an integer height. Thesebuildings form the skyline of a city. An architect wants to know the area of a largest rectanglecontained in this skyline. See Figure 17.5 on the next page for an example.Let A be an array representing the heights of adjacent buildings of unit width. Design an algorithmto compute the area of the largest rectangle contained in this skyline.
Hint: How would you efficiently find the largest rectangle which includes the ith building, and has height A[i]?
