We consider the problem of assigning tasks to workers. Each worker must be assigned exactly twotasks. Each task takes a fixed amount of time. Tasks are independent, i.e., there are no constraints ofthe form "Task 4 cannot start before Task 3 is completed ." Any task can be assigned to any worker.We want to assign tasks to workers so as to minimize how long it takes before all tasks arecompleted. For example, if there are 6 tasks whose durations ate 5,2,1,6,4,4 hours, then anoptimum assignment is to give the first two tasks (i.e., the tasks with duration 5 and 2) to oneworker, the next two (1 and 6) to another worke1 and the last two tasks (4 and 4) to the last worker.For this assignment, all tasks will finish after max(5 + 2,1 + 6,4 + 4) = 8 hours.Design an algorithm that takes as input a set of tasks and retums an optimum assignment.Hint: What additional task should be assigned to the worker who is assigned the longest task?
