"""
An array of integers naturally defines a set of lines parallel to the Y-axis, starting from x = 0 asillustrated in Figure U.a@). The goal of this problem is to find the pair of lines that together withthe X-axis "ttap" the most water. See Figure 17.4b) for an example.

Write a Program which takes as input an integer array and retums the pair of entries that trap themaximum amount of water.Hint: Slart with 0 and z - 1 and work your way in.
