"""
A database has to respond to a set of client SQL queries. The service time required for each queryis known in advance. For this application, the queries must be processed by the database one at atime, but can be done in any order. The time a query waits before its tum comes is called its waitingtime.Given service times for a setof queries, compute a schedule forprocessingthe queries thatminimizesthe total waiting time. Retum the minimum waiting time. For example, if the service times are<2,5,1.,3),if wescheduleinthegivenordeq,thetotalwaitingtimeis0+(2)+(2+5)+(2+5 +1) =17.If however, we schedule queries in order of decreasing service times, the total waiting time is0+(5)+(5+3)+(5+3+2)=23.Aswewillsee,forthisexample,theminimumwaitingtimeisl0.Hint:Focus on extreme values.
